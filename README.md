# Fast-CNN-MCWS-transformer
This repository contains the source code for the Fast (CNN + MCWS-transformer)-based architecture for Protein Function Prediction

This has following main python files.

Segmentation.py - This python file contains the code for doing the segmenation of the protein sequences used for trining the segment encoder.

Fast-MCWS.py - This contains the code for the segment encoder.

train.py - This contains the code for training the segment encoder.

evaluate.py - This contains the code for the evaluation metrics.

The datasets are available for download at google drive: https://bit.ly/3n4giKs

The paper is under process at: Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
