# Fast-CNN-MCWS-transformer
This repository contains the source code for the Fast (CNN + MCWS-transformer)-based architecture for Protein Function Prediction

This is repository for Global-ProtEnc Plus.

This has following main python files.

Segmentation.py - This python file contains the code for doing the segmenation of the protein sequences used for trining the segment encoder.
ProtSSE.py - This contains the model for the segment encoder.
Global-ProtEnc.py - This contains the code for the constrcution of global protein vector.
Global-ProtEnc-Plus.py - This contains the code for the ensembel model.
evaluate.py - This contains the code for the evaluation metrics.
The datasets are available for download at google drive: https://bit.ly/3n4giKs
